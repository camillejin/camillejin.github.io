                    2020 was one of the most difficult times for the local vendors in Sinchon, Seodaemun-Gu area. 
                    Due to COVID-19, social distancing and quarantine were enforced to keep people at home. 
                    In addition to this, Yonsei students, who used to be the main customers of these shops were not around 
                     anymore as the classes were held online. A number of shops in Sinchon were going out of business 
                     or going through financial difficulties. I later found out that for some of the shops, 
                     up to 90% of the sales were raised by students who were enrolled in universities in the area. 
                     Seeing how the change in university operation can hugely impact the livelihood of the locals, 
                     I wanted to learn more about the relationship between the university and the locals in general, 
                     the best practices around the world, the case of Yonsei and Seodaemun-Gu, and potential improvements to be made 
                     to further benefit one another and to overcome difficulties in such situations. I collaborated with two 
                     of my high school colleagues who are also university colleagues. The research was funded by 
                     Underwood International College, Yonsei University.
