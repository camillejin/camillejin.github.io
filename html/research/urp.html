                <p>2020 was one of the most difficult times for the local vendors in Sinchon, Seodaemun-Gu area. <br>
                    Due to COVID-19, social distancing and quarantine were enforced to keep people at home. <br>
                    In addition to this, Yonsei students, who used to be the main customers of these shops were not around <br>
                     anymore as the classes were held online. A number of shops in Sinchon were going out of business <br>
                     or going through financial difficulties. I later found out that for some of the shops, <br>
                     up to 90% of the sales were raised by students who were enrolled in universities in the area. <br>
                     Seeing how the change in university operation can hugely impact the livelihood of the locals, <br>
                     I wanted to learn more about the relationship between the university and the locals in general, <br>
                     the best practices around the world, the case of Yonsei and Seodaemun-Gu, and potential improvements to be made<br>
                     to further benefit one another and to overcome difficulties in such situations. I collaborated with two <br>
                     of my high school colleagues who are also university colleagues. The research was funded by <br>
                     Underwood International College, Yonsei University.
