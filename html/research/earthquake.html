                    During the summer of 2022, I interned at the Digital Media Lab, Yonsei University.
                    I was responsible for developing an earthquake simulation VR,
                     which will be used for an experiment in a design research.
                    The research aimed to test the different designs of mobile application that were
                     developed in order to help people with evacuation when earthquake occurs.
                    The program was required to observe the subjects' behavior in a simulated earthquake.

            <div class="body body-white px-5 d-flex justify-content-center">
                <p class="body-text col-md-7">
                    Prior to the actual development, I collected visual data on how the earthquake should appear.
                    I did a brief research on the effects of earthquakes according to the intensities and collected video clips for reference.
                    This helped in making sure that the lead researchers and I were on the same page.
                    After selecting the intensity level of the earthquke simulation program, based on the reference clips,
                     I made a list of Unity assets that would be required for the program. 
                    The assets were then implemented onto the program to simulate earthquake. I wrote C# scripts,
                     created timeline, and tested with Oculus Quest 2 for fine-tuning. During the process, So Yeon Kim 
                     and other Graduate students at the lab provided excellent advice and support.

                    In order to simulate the earthquake, the shaking effect was added to the camera, instead of the surrounding assets. 
                    Then different assets were implemented and tested out.

                    According to the reference video clips of our choice of intensity, parts of the walls were breaking down from the buildings. 
                    However, it was difficult to modify the pre-built building assets. 
                    Instead, I added dust and debris effects on the wall so that it looks as if the debris were falling from the wall. 
                    I was also able to write a script that causes the streetlights to fall.
